# Sticky

This is a little bit of experimental code I wrote during the SUSE Hackweek VIII
to learn some more about node.js. It became a mixture of node.js, socket.io,
Redis, HTML, CSS, and jQuery.

The app does not much more than creating sticky notes on a canvas when you click
it.

## Setup

* Make sure node is installed (for openSUSE go to http://software.opensuse.org)
* Make sure Redis is installed (for openSUSE http://software.opensuse.org again)
* Run "npm i redis" to install the Redis driver for node
* Start Redis (on openSUSE do "sudo /usr/sbin/rcredis start")
* Run "npm i step" to install the Step helpers for synchronizing asynchronius
  function calls
* Run "npm i socket.io" to install the socket.io library for two-way
  server-client communication
* Run server with "node server.js"
* Point your browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
* Click

## Configuration

Configuration for application is set in config.json. You can override settings
by providing environment variables. Use '__' (double underscore) as a separator
for creating nested entries, e.g. db__host=myhost.
